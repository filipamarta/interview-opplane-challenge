# Notes App
A React Notes app with CRUD implementation. The user can add, delete or edit a note, and they should be persisted in the browser's Local Storage. 

The tech used was ReactJS (with Context and Hooks), Javascript ES6, SASS, UUID and Bootstrap. 
It was build with Netlify and you can see it live here: https://notes-app-challenge.netlify.app/. 

This app was built as a tech challenge for *Opplane*.

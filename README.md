# Notes App
An app for *Opplane* code challenge developed by **Filipa Marta** with simple text notes that can be viewed, created, modified, and deleted, and are persisted in the browser's Local Storage.

The tech used was ReactJS (with Context and Hooks), Javascript ES6, SASS, UUID and Bootstrap. 
It was build with Netlify and you can see it live here: https://notes-app-challenge.netlify.app/.
